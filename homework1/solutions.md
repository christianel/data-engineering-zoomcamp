# Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

## Question 1. Understanding Docker images

Answer: The Dockerfile is in the repo. 

In the shell, I can run the following two commands: 

```
docker build -t test:pipversion .
docker run -it --rm test:pipversion
pip --version
```

The version of `pip` in the image is

25.3



## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

It is postgres:5432. 

## Question 3. Counting short trips

- 7,853
- 8,007
- 8,254
- 8,421


## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with `trip_distance` less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2025-11-20
- 2025-11-23

## Question 6. Largest tip
